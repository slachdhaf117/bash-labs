# Bash Labs

A collection of scripts I've made while improving my shell scripting skills with a DevOps mindset.

## What’s inside

**Text processing**
Scripts to extract, clean, and transform data from logs and command output.

**System automation**
Small automations for monitoring resources, running checks, and generating quick reports.

**Security checks**
Basic log inspection and simple credential-leak detection in local environments.

**Data normalization**
Turning messy command output into cleaner formats like CSV or JSON when needed.

## Repository structure

- /text-processing - log parsing, filtering, config file edits  
- /file-automation - batch file operations and scanning tasks  
- /system-checks - CPU, memory, and disk usage checks  

## Tools I mainly used

Mostly standard Linux utilities, CLI tools and scripting:

"find", "xargs", pipes, redirection, "cut", "tr", "sort", "uniq", "wc"
